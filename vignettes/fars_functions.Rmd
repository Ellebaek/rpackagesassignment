library(rpackagesassignment)

## Description

This is a package which enables users to read and summarize FARS data. 

## Usage
To get started, users should have a local library with FARS data on their laptop
and files should be named `accident_<yyyy>.csv.bz2`. Then the user should set 
the working directory of their R session to the folder with the FARS data, and 
then the functionality can be used.
