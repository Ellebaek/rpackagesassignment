This is a package which enables users to read and summarize FARS data. To get
started, users should have a local library with FARS data on their laptop and 
files should be named "accident_<yyyy>.csv.bz2". Then the user should set the 
working directory of their R session to the folder with the FARS data, and then
the functionality can be used.
